## Hello there Stranger!
Hello! I'm Marvin, and this is my personal blog. I'm a huge tech geek and spends a good amount of time building scalable applications. I fell in love with technology from games -- building game servers when I was a teenager for a game called Garry's Mod. When I am not coding I love to chasing the powder in the mountains with my snowboard, exploring new food scenes and learn more about the world around me with travel.

This blog is just my digital journal to share my insights on tech, adventures, and unexpected findings.
