My journey into tech started with an obsession: Garry's Mod server administration. What began as a hobby running game servers turned into a full-fledged passion for programming and system architecture.

## The Beginning
- Learning Lua for server scripts
- Managing player communities
- Troubleshooting server issues
- Building custom game modes

This early experience laid the foundation for my current career in software engineering.
